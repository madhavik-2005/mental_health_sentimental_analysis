**Mental Health Status Prediction Using Sentiment Analysis**

**Overview**

This project aims to predict the mental health status of individuals based on their statements. The model analyzes textual data using sentiment analysis and classifies the statements into one of seven mental health categories:

    Normal
    Depression
    Suicidal
    Anxiety
    Stress
    Bi-Polar
    Personality Disorder
    
The project uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify text data, providing early insights that could help mental health professionals with diagnosis and intervention.

**Project Description**

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the mental health status of an individual based on their text inputs. Using sentiment analysis, the model classifies text data into the following categories: Normal, Depression, Suicidal, Anxiety, Stress, Bi-Polar, and Personality Disorder.

This approach leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful patterns from unstructured text data, which can be useful in early-stage identification and intervention for mental health conditions.

**Technologies Used**

      Python: The programming language used for developing the project.
      Scikit-learn: A machine learning library for building models and evaluation.
      TensorFlow/Keras (if using neural networks): For training deep learning models.
      NLTK: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and stopword removal.
      Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization (e.g., plotting graphs, accuracy, loss).
      Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
      NumPy: For numerical operations.

**Data Description**

The dataset consists of statements from individuals, with labels representing the mental health condition they correspond to.

Example Dataset:

    Statement	Mental| Health Status
    "oh my gosh"|	Anxiety
    "trouble sleeping, confused mind, restless heart..."	|Anxiety
    "All wrong, back off dear, forward doubt. Stay away"|	Anxiety
    "I've shifted my focus to something else but I’m restless..."|	Anxiety
    "I'm restless and restless, it's been a month now..."	|Anxiety

**Model Development**

We apply machine learning and NLP techniques to develop the model. Here are the steps followed in the model development:

**Data Preprocessing: Done By the K L Sreya 2022BCD0031**

    Clean and tokenize text.
    Remove stop words and non-alphabetic characters.
    Perform lemmatization or stemming to reduce words to their base form.

**Feature Extraction:Done By the K L Sreya 2022BCD0031**

    Convert text data into numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

**Model Training: Done By the K Madhavi 2022BCD0016**

    The model is trained using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Neural Networks.
    Hyperparameters are tuned to improve accuracy.
    
**Model Evaluation:Done By the K Madhavi 2022BCD0016**

    The model is evaluated using accuracy and other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
    The model’s performance is visualized using confusion matrices and loss/accuracy curves.

**Training the Model**

To train the model, the following steps are executed:

    1. Load the dataset: Use the Pandas library to load the dataset into a DataFrame.
    2. Text preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data using NLTK or similar libraries.
    3. Feature extraction: Convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF.
    4. Split the data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split from Scikit-learn.
    5. Model selection: Choose and train a machine learning model (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.).
    6. Model evaluation: Calculate the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test set.
    7. Save the trained model: The trained model is saved using joblib or pickle for future use.   

**Evaluation**

After training the model, we evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we visualize training progress and loss curves using Matplotlib.

    Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions.
    Precision: The proportion of positive predictions that were actually correct.
    Recall: The proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified.
    F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
